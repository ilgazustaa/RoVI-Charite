# RoVI-Charite
#Project overview

This project analyzes why the oral rotavirus vaccine shows variable immune responses in infants.
We study the relationship between gut microbiome composition, maternal antibodies, neonatal rotavirus infection status, and vaccine-induced IgA antibody responses.

The goal is to reproduce and explore findings from a large multicountry infant cohort study and to practice reproducible data analysis.

#Repository structure
data/        → datasets used for analysis (not tracked on GitHub)
notebooks/   → Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
src/         → reusable Python scripts
figures/     → plots generated by the notebooks


#How to run the analysis

Open Terminal

Navigate to the project folder:

cd RoVI-Charite


Install required Python packages (run once):

pip install -r requirements.txt


Start Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


In the browser window, open:

notebooks/01_visualize_data.ipynb

Data availability

The data analyzed in this project are publicly available from the original study, but are not included in this repository.
Users should download the data from the original source and place them in:

data/raw/

Notes

This repository focuses on analysis code and visualization, not data hosting

Raw data files should not be committed to GitHub

All results can be reproduced once the data are placed in the correct folder
