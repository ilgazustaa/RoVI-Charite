# RoVI-Charite

## Project overview
This project analyzes why the **oral rotavirus vaccine** shows variable immune responses in infants.

We study the relationship between:
- Gut microbiome composition (16S rRNA sequencing)
- Maternal antibodies
- Neonatal rotavirus infection status
- Vaccine-induced IgA antibody responses

The goal is to **reproduce and explore findings from a large multicountry infant cohort study** and to practice reproducible data analysis.
